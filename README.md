Build own code review rules using CodeRabbit, Test new features.

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple RESTful API using Kotlin and Spring Boot  
while experimenting with CodeRabbit's code review features. The main goal is  
to gradually develop custom code review rules that fit our needs by testing  
each feature of CodeRabbit. Additionally, this project serves as an opportunity  
to contribute to open source development.

The project serves two primary purposes:

1. **Experimenting with CodeRabbit**: The goal is to experiment with creating  
   optimized code review rules that fit user requirements by analyzing commit  
   contexts and messages during the review process. This involves testing whether  
   CodeRabbit's AI can learn and adapt based on these insights.

2. **Open Source Contribution**: This project is also intended to contribute  
   to the open-source community. By sharing our code and custom CodeRabbit  
   configurations, we hope to help others improve their code quality practices.
